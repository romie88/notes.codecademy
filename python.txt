*** Lists and Functions

** List Recap

1. List accessing
# n is a list
n[ index ] where index starts from 0

2. List element modification
x[ n ] = v

3. Appending to a list
n.append( item )

4. Removing elements from lists
# n is a list
n.pop( index ) will remove the item at index from the list and return it
n.remove( item ) will remove the actual item if it finds it
del( n[ index ] ) is like n.pop( index ) but it won't return the removed item
n.pop() will remove the last item from the list

8. Passing a list to a function

9. Using an element from a list in a function

10. Modifying an element of a list in a function
List is passed in by reference

11. List manipulation in functions
You can also append or delete items of a list inside a function just as if you were manipulating the list outside a function.

** Using the Entire List in a function

12. Printing out a list item by item in a function
for i in range( 0, len( x ) )
	print x[ i ]

13. Modifying each element in a list in a function

14. Passing a range into a function
range( stop ) # => [ 0, 1, ..., stop - 1 ]
range( start, stop ) # => [ start, ..., stop - 1 ]
range( start, stop, step ) # => [ start, start + step, ... , < stop ]
In all cases, range() returns a list of numbers from start up to (but not including) stop. Each item increases by step.
If omitted, start defaults to zero and step defaults to one.

15. Iterating over a list in a function
Method 1
for item in list:
	print item
Method 2
for i in range( len( list ) ):
	print list[ i ]
Method 1 is useful to loop through the list, but it's not possible to modify the list this way.
Method 2 uses indexes to loop through the list, making it possible to also modify the list if needed.

16. Using strings in lists in functions

** Using Lists of Lists in Functions

17. Using two lists as two arguments in a function
You can just use + to concatenate two lists. (You don't want to use append, because this just adds the entire second list as a single object at the end of the first.)

18. Using a list of lists in a function
